# ADHD Life OS — Current Status

**Snapshot date:** 31 August 2026  
**Default branch:** `main`  
**Overall status:** Active development / backend provider work intentionally deferred  
**Current phase/stage:** Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience

## Current objective

Resume from fresh `main` after **PR #166 — Routine Statistics Recent Completions list semantics**. That slice exposes the visually coherent routine-history collection as one heading-labelled semantic list and each rendered history entry as a list item, while preserving statistics retrieval, history ordering, timeframe selection, metric/progress presentation, dialog behaviour, persistence and provider boundaries.

## AI execution gate

| Gate field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Current gate | CHANGE |
| Gate state | RE-ENTRY — no implementation PR should be assumed active from this file after #166 merges |
| Execution state | READY |
| Backend/provider state | DEFERRED / UNVERIFIED |
| Current restriction | Do not infer or activate physical NoCodeBackend routes, methods, schemas or durable execution behaviour until provider work is explicitly resumed with real target evidence. |

## Re-entry checkpoint after PR #166 merges

| State | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| Current stage | Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience |
| Active delivery thread | None until live `main` and open PRs/branches are inspected |
| Last completed product outcome | PR #166 — Routine Statistics Recent Completions collection semantics |
| Current blocker | None expected |
| Deferred dependency | NoCodeBackend/provider certification; production deployment remains unverified |
| Next action | Inspect remaining frontend accessibility evidence; if none is concrete, move to the next evidence-backed cognitive-load slice |

## Autonomous continuation entry answers

| Question | Durable answer |
| --- | --- |
| Where am I? | Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience. |
| What is already happening? | Do not assume an active implementation thread from this checkpoint; inspect live GitHub state first. |
| What has been validated? | PR #165 exact head `935ffadcefa9cbd29de20e5d5b7339efcb63db45` passed canonical Application validation before guarded merge at `051e58af6bacdb1971d493efafcf697a0fe0de7e`. PR #166 must independently pass exact-head canonical validation before merge. |
| What changed? | Routine Statistics now exposes Recent Completions with the list structure already conveyed visually, without changing statistics, history or persistence behaviour. |
| What is next? | Inspect fresh `main`, open PRs/branches/checks, then continue the next dependency-correct accessibility or cognitive-load slice. |
| Can I proceed autonomously? | Yes. No owner decision is currently required. |
| Why should I stop? | Only for a stop/escalation condition defined in `AGENTS.md`, an external dependency blocking all dependency-correct work, or no actionable work. |

## Recent completed outcomes

PRs #124–#165 progressively established disclosure, task/filter/sort and collection semantics, modal/menu keyboard and focus integrity, Housework/onboarding/template/Gamification accessibility, Today timeline semantics, Brain Inbox Capture/Organize semantics, TaskSelector/recommendation semantics, Project Detail task collections/progress semantics, Accessibility Settings control descriptions, Routine Progress step semantics, and the Vite NCB test-server response adapter required by canonical browser validation.

PR #166 extends that accessibility baseline to Routine Statistics’ Recent Completions history collection.

## Backend / provider work — intentionally deferred

**State:** PROVIDER UNVERIFIED / TEMPORARILY DEFERRED.

Keep provider mappings fail-closed, do not infer physical NoCodeBackend contracts, and continue independent frontend/accessibility/testing work until real provider evidence is available.

## Quality / technical state

- `npm run platform:validate` remains the canonical project-owned validation gate.
- PR #165 exact head passed canonical validation before guarded merge.
- PR #166 has focused deterministic coverage but still requires exact-head canonical validation before lifecycle completion.
- Roadmap priority while backend work is deferred remains frontend accessibility/interaction integrity, then cognitive-load reduction, then focused maintainability.
- Production deployment remains unverified/unconfigured for ADHD Life OS.
- Repository merge proves repository integration only; it does not prove deployment/provider/runtime readiness.

## Next dependency-correct work

1. inspect live `main`, open PRs, visible branches and checks;
2. reuse or repair any active/overlapping implementation before creating new work;
3. continue the next evidence-backed frontend accessibility/interaction issue;
4. if accessibility evidence is exhausted, move to client-side cognitive-load reduction;
5. keep provider-dependent execution work deferred until real provider evidence exists.

## Stage 3 exit conditions

Stage 3 remains open until the platform demonstrates authoritative execution policy, a clear next-action experience, reversible feedback, durable start/continue, interruption/recovery, source reconciliation, deterministic/browser tests and aligned documentation. The temporary backend deferral does not remove or weaken those exit conditions.

# ADHD Life OS — Current Status

**Snapshot date:** 31 August 2026  
**Default branch:** `main`  
**Overall status:** Active development / backend provider work intentionally deferred  
**Current phase/stage:** Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience

## Current objective

Resume from fresh `main` after the **Tasks loading-status semantics** slice. The Tasks route now exposes its visible “Loading tasks...” feedback as a polite atomic busy status and hides the decorative spinner from assistive technology without changing task loading, filtering, sorting, persistence or provider behaviour.

## AI execution gate

| Gate field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Current gate | CHANGE |
| Gate state | RE-ENTRY — no implementation PR should be assumed active from this file after the Tasks loading-status slice merges |
| Execution state | READY |
| Backend/provider state | DEFERRED / UNVERIFIED |
| Current restriction | Do not infer or activate physical NoCodeBackend routes, methods, schemas or durable execution behaviour until provider work is explicitly resumed with real target evidence. |

## Re-entry checkpoint after the Tasks loading-status slice merges

| State | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| Current stage | Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience |
| Active delivery thread | None until live `main` and open PRs/branches are inspected |
| Last completed product outcome | The Tasks route initial loading state is programmatically announced without exposing its decorative spinner |
| Current blocker | None expected |
| Deferred dependency | NoCodeBackend/provider certification; production deployment remains unverified |
| Next action | Inspect remaining frontend accessibility evidence; if none is concrete, move to the next evidence-backed cognitive-load slice |

## Autonomous continuation entry answers

| Question | Durable answer |
| --- | --- |
| Where am I? | Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience. |
| What is already happening? | Do not assume an active implementation thread from this checkpoint; inspect live GitHub state first. |
| What has been validated? | PR #170 exact head `403c57dfbc720b5139d0cde055a4aa91eae2c029` passed Application validation run 346 and merged at `522a54ca44c2b4dc43f81622bbf30f9d17b52b49`. The Tasks loading-status slice must independently pass exact-head canonical validation before merge. |
| What changed? | The Tasks route initial loading feedback now has polite atomic busy-status semantics, while its decorative spinner is hidden from assistive technology. |
| What is next? | Inspect fresh `main`, open PRs/branches/checks, then continue the next dependency-correct accessibility or cognitive-load slice. |
| Can I proceed autonomously? | Yes. No owner decision is currently required. |
| Why should I stop? | Only for a stop/escalation condition defined in `AGENTS.md`, an external dependency blocking all dependency-correct work, or no actionable work. |

## Recent completed outcomes

PRs #124–#167 progressively established disclosure, task/filter/sort and collection semantics, modal/menu keyboard and focus integrity, Housework/onboarding/template/Gamification accessibility, Today timeline semantics, Brain Inbox Capture/Organize semantics, TaskSelector/recommendation semantics, Project Detail task collections/progress semantics, Accessibility Settings control descriptions, Routine Progress step semantics, Routine Statistics history and key-metric semantics, and the Vite NCB test-server response adapter required by canonical browser validation.

PR #168 extended that accessibility baseline to the shared application loading fallback used across authentication/session, onboarding and lazy-route transitions. PR #169 extended transient-state accessibility to shared celebration completion feedback. PR #170 applied the same architecture principle to Today’s route-level initial loading state. The current Tasks loading-status slice applies it to the Tasks route initial loading state.

## Backend / provider work — intentionally deferred

**State:** PROVIDER UNVERIFIED / TEMPORARILY DEFERRED.

Keep provider mappings fail-closed, do not infer physical NoCodeBackend contracts, and continue independent frontend/accessibility/testing work until real provider evidence is available.

## Quality / technical state

- `npm run platform:validate` remains the canonical project-owned validation gate.
- PR #170 exact head passed Application validation run 346 before guarded merge.
- The Tasks loading-status slice has focused deterministic coverage but still requires exact-head canonical validation before lifecycle completion.
- Roadmap priority while backend work is deferred remains frontend accessibility/interaction integrity, then cognitive-load reduction, then focused maintainability.
- Production deployment remains unverified/unconfigured for ADHD Life OS.
- Repository merge proves repository integration only; it does not prove deployment/provider/runtime readiness.

## Next dependency-correct work

1. inspect live `main`, open PRs, visible branches and checks;
2. reuse or repair any active/overlapping implementation before creating new work;
3. continue the next evidence-backed frontend accessibility/interaction issue;
4. if accessibility evidence is exhausted, move to client-side cognitive-load reduction;
5. keep provider-dependent execution work deferred until real provider evidence exists.

## Stage 3 exit conditions

Stage 3 remains open until the platform demonstrates authoritative execution policy, a clear next-action experience, reversible feedback, durable start/continue, interruption/recovery, source reconciliation, deterministic/browser tests and aligned documentation. The temporary backend deferral does not remove or weaken those exit conditions.

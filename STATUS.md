# ADHD Life OS — Current Status

**Snapshot date:** 31 August 2026  
**Default branch:** `main`  
**Overall status:** Active development / backend provider work intentionally deferred  
**Current phase/stage:** Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience

## Current objective

Resume from fresh `main` after **PR #168 — shared application loading-status semantics**. That slice exposes the shared `LoadingScreen` used by session verification, onboarding checks, Suspense/lazy routes and unresolved route state as a polite atomic busy status while keeping its decorative spinner hidden from assistive technology.

## AI execution gate

| Gate field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Current gate | CHANGE |
| Gate state | RE-ENTRY — no implementation PR should be assumed active from this file after #168 merges |
| Execution state | READY |
| Backend/provider state | DEFERRED / UNVERIFIED |
| Current restriction | Do not infer or activate physical NoCodeBackend routes, methods, schemas or durable execution behaviour until provider work is explicitly resumed with real target evidence. |

## Re-entry checkpoint after PR #168 merges

| State | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| Current stage | Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience |
| Active delivery thread | None until live `main` and open PRs/branches are inspected |
| Last completed product outcome | PR #168 — shared application loading-status semantics |
| Current blocker | None expected |
| Deferred dependency | NoCodeBackend/provider certification; production deployment remains unverified |
| Next action | Inspect remaining frontend accessibility evidence; if none is concrete, move to the next evidence-backed cognitive-load slice |

## Autonomous continuation entry answers

| Question | Durable answer |
| --- | --- |
| Where am I? | Stage 3 — execution and next-action experience. |
| What is already happening? | Do not assume an active implementation thread from this checkpoint; inspect live GitHub state first. |
| What has been validated? | PR #167 exact head `56225a6ade8504efa37c767d05772358cdee0805` passed Application validation run 342 and merged at `531034f5d580a2b15b05cd3cdf2378dc9202b581`. PR #168 must independently pass exact-head canonical validation before merge. |
| What changed? | The shared app loading fallback now announces its visible Loading state programmatically without exposing its decorative spinner or changing loading policy. |
| What is next? | Inspect fresh `main`, open PRs/branches/checks, then continue the next dependency-correct accessibility or cognitive-load slice. |
| Can I proceed autonomously? | Yes. No owner decision is currently required. |
| Why should I stop? | Only for a stop/escalation condition defined in `AGENTS.md`, an external dependency blocking all dependency-correct work, or no actionable work. |

## Recent completed outcomes

PRs #124–#167 progressively established disclosure, task/filter/sort and collection semantics, modal/menu keyboard and focus integrity, Housework/onboarding/template/Gamification accessibility, Today timeline semantics, Brain Inbox Capture/Organize semantics, TaskSelector/recommendation semantics, Project Detail task collections/progress semantics, Accessibility Settings control descriptions, Routine Progress step semantics, Routine Statistics history and key-metric semantics, and the Vite NCB test-server response adapter required by canonical browser validation.

PR #168 extends that accessibility baseline to the shared application loading fallback used across authentication/session, onboarding and lazy-route transitions.

## Backend / provider work — intentionally deferred

**State:** PROVIDER UNVERIFIED / TEMPORARILY DEFERRED.

Keep provider mappings fail-closed, do not infer physical NoCodeBackend contracts, and continue independent frontend/accessibility/testing work until real provider evidence is available.

## Quality / technical state

- `npm run platform:validate` remains the canonical project-owned validation gate.
- PR #167 exact head passed Application validation run 342 before guarded merge.
- PR #168 has focused deterministic coverage but still requires exact-head canonical validation before lifecycle completion.
- Roadmap priority while backend work is deferred remains frontend accessibility/interaction integrity, then cognitive-load reduction, then focused maintainability.
- Production deployment remains unverified/unconfigured for ADHD Life OS.
- Repository merge proves repository integration only; it does not prove deployment/provider/runtime readiness.

## Next dependency-correct work

1. inspect live `main`, open PRs, visible branches and checks;
2. reuse or repair any active/overlapping implementation before creating new work;
3. continue the next evidence-backed frontend accessibility/interaction issue;
4. if accessibility evidence is exhausted, move to client-side cognitive-load reduction;
5. keep provider-dependent execution work deferred until real provider evidence exists.

## Stage 3 exit conditions

Stage 3 remains open until the platform demonstrates authoritative execution policy, a clear next-action experience, reversible feedback, durable start/continue, interruption/recovery, source reconciliation, deterministic/browser tests and aligned documentation. The temporary backend deferral does not remove or weaken those exit conditions.
